# 66Days
This repo was created as part of a personal challenge to practice algorithms, systems design, bits and bytes and scripting. My thoughts as I went through the challenge are in a series of publications on Medium https://medium.com/66-days/day-1-fb0f1fbce484#.g896ma2vz. The experience was a powerful one. I learned and practiced a lot and founded a lot of stuff.
